It was established at the inception stage of the Calicut Regional Engineering College (CREC), which was the forerunner to the present National Institute of Technology, Calicut (NITC) in 1961. Over the years, the Department has grown from a level in which only an undergraduate program leading to a Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering was offered to one offering undergraduate, graduate, and research programs. At present, the Department offers an undergraduate program in Civil Engineering leading to the BTech degree and four graduate programs - one each in Structural Engineering, Traffic and Transportation Planning, Offshore Structures, and Environmental Geotechnology leading to the MTech degree of the Institute. In addition to the above, there are a number of students pursuing research at the Department in various fields of Civil Engineering leading to PhD. The Department is a recognized QIP centre of the AICTE for both MTech and PhD programs. At present, the Department is also offering a Post Graduate Diploma course in Construction Management. In addition to the above courses, the Department has been regularly conducting a number of short term training programs for the benefit of faculty of technical institutions and working professionals. \n The Department is also actively engaged in R&D, testing and consultancy activities. A number of R&D projects sponsored by various departments and organisations including the Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD)and the Department of Science &Technology (DST), Government of India, AICTE, ADRB, NPOL, Coir Board, and the Kerala State Council for Science Technology and Environment (KSCSTE) have been completed and many are presently in progress. The Department has offered and continues to offer testing and consultancy services to various government departments and organizations in both the public and private sectors. The Government of Kerala has approved the Department as an authority for checking and scrutinising designs of public works. Consultancy services are being offered in all fields of Civil Engineering interest. \n The laboratories of the Department are well equipped. A major modernisation of various laboratories in the Department was taken up under the Technical Education Quality Improvement Program (TEQIP) of the Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Government of India, during 2002-2006. The next phase of this program is expected to be launched shortly"
6,"Computer Science & Engineering","Department","BTech programme in Computer Science and Engineering started in 1985 under the Department of Electrical Engineering. The Department of Computer Science and Engineering was formed in June 1997. The three-year MCA programme started in 1988. The two-year MTech programme in Computer Science and Engineering started in 1998. The two-year MTech programme in Computer Science and Engineering (Information Security) started in 2006. PhD programme started in 2002."

24,"School of Biotechnology","School","Biotechnology is the engineering of products involving living organisms or their derivatives. Earlier it was used mainly in agriculture and wine industry without knowing molecular basis of plant transformation or product formation. However, the earth-shaking discovery of DNA double helix by J. D. Watson and F. C. Crick in early 1950s revolutionized this field as never-before and paved the way for understanding life at cellular and molecular level. The discovery of restriction enzymes (molecular scissors) gave birth to recombinant DNA technology and it allows the manipulation of genetic makeup of any organism including human being at will. This field is popularly known as Genetic Engineering. It has made possible the cloning of individual genes and the whole organism as well. The cloning of Dolly the sheep by Ian Wilmut and colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1996, was a major milestone in science and technology and holds out hope for therapeutic cloning. Modern biotechnology is also associated with the use of genetically modified organisms like bacterium Escherichia coli, baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plants and animals for the production of antibiotics or biological molecules of human origin. For example, human insulin gene was cloned into a plasmid and transformed into E. coli to produce large quantities of biologically functional insulin to meet the increasing demand of this product for the treatment of diabetes. Also, genetically modified plants are developed to get increased yield, high nutritional value and to make them pest resistant or salt tolerant.  \n Over the years, biotechnology has evolved as an interdisciplinary area of science and technology having linked with many engineering fields like chemical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and so on. For example, technological revolution in computer science played a pivotal role for processing of millions of DNA sequences coming out from whole genome sequencing of different organisms including humans. The human genome sequence revealed that 99.9% sequences of any two individuals are same and an individual is different from others because of only 0.10% DNA sequences. What does it reveal? Besides, 98.5% of human genome comprises of non-coding sequences. This puzzle is not easy to solve. And there are about 30,000 genes in this genome and functions of most of them are still unknown. Similarly, there are thousands of unknown genes in bacteria, yeast, protozoa, soil worms, plants and in all the vertebrates. Understanding of the biological processes in all these living organisms will revolutionize the pharmaceutical industries, food industries, agriculture sector, heath care etc. and will provide solutions to different problems like aging, cancer development, infections caused by viruses and microbes and so on. It is a challenge for new generation of budding scientists and technocrats to crack this problem and contribute to science and technology so that mankind will be benefited."
